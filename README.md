# DoD-Award-Data-Analysis
Data analysis of the Department of Defense (DoD) small business awards. 

This code was built for the Capstone project in Business Intelligence and Data Analyticsat CSU Global. It is desined to provide an analysis of the set-aside contracts, and compare them to the contracts with no set-aside requirements.
Government acquires goods and services through publishing opportunities and opening them for competition. The main difficulty of working in federal procurement is that most of the laws and regulations followed by the awarding federal agency extend to their contractors, which requires companies to complete a number of additional steps to qualify for the award from obtaining certifications and establishing approved systems. Furthermore, long-term success may require frequent consideration for creating new strategic partnerships and business acquisitions. 
Work in the field of national defense is highly regulated due to its sensitive nature, making business with the Department of Defense (DoD) especially complicated. For small businesses, preparing a response to a solicitation can be a lengthy and expensive process. Sparse resources require government contractors to perform a cost-benefit analysis before attempting to bid on opportunities in order to minimize time and expense spent on the solicitations that are not a viable choice. The goal of this project is to analyze public data on awarded defense contracts in an attempt to find and analyze any patterns that can be useful for small businesses that are trying to solicit work with the DoD.

This Python code uses data from https://www.usaspending.gov/download_center/custom_award_data. For this analysis the data is filtered by the single federal agency (DoD), and only includes definitive contracts awarded to small businesses.
